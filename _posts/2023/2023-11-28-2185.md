    desc: 'Projects promoting bees in urban areas are initiated in cities around the
      world but evidence-based conservation concepts at a city-wide scale are scarce.
      We developed a holistic approach for assessment of bee and flowering plant diversity
      in a medium-sized city. In addition to standard mapping approaches in bee hotspots,
      we initiated citizen science projects for participative urban bee research to
      be able to collect comprehensive bee data across the entire city. We identified
      22 hotspots of bee diversity, analyzed connectivity between those hotspots and
      evaluated the impact of flower patches planted in collaboration with the municipal
      gardens department as stepping stones for oligolectic bee species throughout
      the city. Participation by urban citizens in bee identification trainings was
      high (c. 630 persons) but their subsequent contribution through observation
      reports was relatively low (1,165 records by 140 observers). However, we identified
      a total of 139 bee taxa, seven of them only discovered by citizen scientists.
      Total species richness was higher in extensively managed orchards than in semi-natural
      and wasteland areas. Half of the stepping stone flower patches were occupied
      by the target oligolectic bee species in the year of planting. After 3 years,
      all but two species could be confirmed. We suggest a 5-step concept for bee
      management in cities: (1) identification of bee hotspots combined with standardized
      surveys, especially of rare species; (2) training of citize…'
