      population difference from the GHSL data, and how to visualize the results using
      ggplot2 and tidyterra. You will also learn how to categorize the population
      change into three groups: decline, uninhabited, and growth. By the end of this
      tutorial, you will have the skills and the code to create your own map of population
      change in any country you want.'
