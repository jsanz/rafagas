    desc: Extreme events are increasing in frequency and severity due to climate change,
      making the littoral zone even more vulnerable and requiring continuous monitoring
      for its optimized management. The low-lying Ebro Delta ecosystem, located in
      the NW Mediterranean, was subject to Storm Gloria in the winter of 2020, the
      most severe coastal storm registered in the area in decades and one of the most
      intense ever recorded in the Mediterranean. This event caused intense rainfall,
      severe flooding, the erosion of beaches, and the destruction of coastal infrastructures.
      In this study, the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellites were used to monitor
      the flooding impact and water quality status, including chlorophyll-a, suspended
      particulate matter, and turbidity, to evaluate the pre-, syn-, and post-storm
      scenarios. Image processing was carried out using the ACOLITE software and the
      on-the-cloud Google Earth Engine platform for the water quality and flood mapping,
      respectively, showing a consistent performance for both satellites. This cost-effective
      methodology allowed us to characterize the main water quality variation in the
      coastal environment during the storm and detect a higher flooding impact compared
      to the one registered three days later by the Copernicus Emergency Service for
      the same area. Moreover, the time series revealed how the detrimental impact
      on the water quality and turbidity conditions was restored two weeks after the
      extreme weather event. While transitional plumes of sediment discharge were
      formed, no phytoplankton blooms appeared during the study period in the delta.
      These results demonstrate that the workflow implemented is suitable for monitoring
      extreme coastal events using open satellite imagery at 10–30 m spatial resolution,
      thus providing valuable information for early warning to facilitate timely assistance
      and hazard impact evaluation. The integration of these tools into ecological
      disaster management can significantly improve current monitoring strategies,
      supporting decision-makers from the local to the national level in prevention,
      adaptation measures, and damage compensation.
