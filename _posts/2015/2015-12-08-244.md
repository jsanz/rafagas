    desc: ‘Mapping the Klan’ is a rough timeline of the rise of the second Ku Klux
      Klan between 1915 and 1940. Each red dot shows a local unit or ‘Klavern.’ The
      official numbers for each Klavern indicate a basic chronology for the chartering
      of the Klaverns, and they also reveal patterns of Klan organizing.
