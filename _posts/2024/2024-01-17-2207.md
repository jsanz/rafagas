    desc: Ronco and colleagues analyze disaster-induced movements in the presence
      of floods, storms, and landslides during 2016â€“2021, providing empirical evidence
      that differential vulnerability exists and quantifying its extent. They achieve
      this by employing explainable machine learning techniques to model and understand
      internal displacement flows and patterns from observational data.
