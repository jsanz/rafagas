    desc: 'In the last decade, substantial improvements have been achieved in quantitative
      satellite precipitation estimates, which are essential for a wide range of applications.
      In this study, we evaluated the performance of Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals
      for GPM (IMERG V06B) at the sub-daily and daily scales. Ten years of half-hourly
      precipitation records aggregated at different sub-daily periods were evaluated
      over a region in the Western Mediterranean. The analysis at the half-hourly
      scale examined the contribution of passive microwave (PMW) and infrared (IR)
      sources in IMERG estimates, as well as the relationship between various microphysical
      cloud properties using Cloud Microphysics (CMIC–NWC SAF) data. The results show
      the following: (1) a marked tendency to underestimate precipitation compared
      to rain gauges which increases with rainfall intensity and temporal resolution,
      (2) a weaker negative bias for retrievals with PMW data, (3) an increased bias
      when filling PMW gaps by including IR information, and (4) an improved performance
      in the presence of precipitating ice clouds compared to warm and mixed-phase
      clouds. This work contributes to the understanding of the factors affecting
      satellite estimates of extreme precipitation. Their relationship with the microphysical
      characteristics of clouds generates added value for further downstream applications
      and users’ decision making.'
