    desc: Land cover (LC) maps are used extensively for nature conservation and landscape
      planning, but low spatial resolution and coarse LC schemas typically limit their
      applicability to large, broadly defined habitats. In order to target smaller
      and more-specific habitats, LC maps must be developed at high resolution and
      fine class detail using automated methods that can efficiently scale to large
      areas of interest. In this work, we present a Machine Learning approach that
      addresses this challenge. First, we developed a multi-stage semantic segmentation
      approach that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify LC across
      the Peak District National Park (PDNP, 1439 km2) in the UK using a detailed,
      hierarchical LC schema. High-level classes were predicted with 95% accuracy
      and were subsequently used as masks to predict low-level classes with 72% to
      92% accuracy. Next, we used these predictions to analyse the degree and distribution
      of fragmentation of one specific habitat—wet grassland and rush pasture—at the
      landscape scale in the PDNP. We found that fragmentation varied across areas
      designated as primary habitat, highlighting the importance of high-resolution
      LC maps provided by CNN-powered analysis for nature conservation.

      Sentinel-2 satellite data, and WorldClim and SoilGrids environmental data. SatBird
      is composed of 3 sub-datasets: (i) USA summer dataset, generally corresponding
      to the breeding season, (ii) USA winter dataset, the nonbreeding season, (iii)
      Kenya dataset, as an example of a low-data regime. 670 and 1054 bird species
      are considered for the USA and Kenya respectively.'
