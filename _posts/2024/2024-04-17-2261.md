    desc: Abstract. Knowledge of the spatial and temporal distribution of surface
      water is important for water resource management, flood risk assessment, monitoring
      ecosystem health, constraining estimates of biogeochemical cycles and understanding
      our climate. While global-scale spatiotemporal change detection of surface water
      has significantly improved in recent years due to planetary-scale remote sensing
      and computing, it has remained challenging to distinguish the changing characteristics
      of rivers and lakes. Here we analyze the spatial extent of permanent and seasonal
      rivers and lakes globally over the past 38 years based on new data of river
      system extents and surface water trends. Results show that while the total permanent
      surface area of both rivers and lakes has remained relatively constant, the
      areas with intermittent seasonal coverage have increased by 12 % and 27 % for
      rivers and lakes, respectively. The increase is statistically significant in
      over 84 % of global water catchments based on Spearman’s rank correlations (rho)
      above 0.05 and p values less than 0.05. The seasonal river extent is nearly
      32 % larger than the previously observed annual mean river extent, suggesting
      large seasonal variations that impact not only ecosystem health but also estimations
      of terrestrial biogeochemical cycles of carbon. The outcomes of our analysis
      are shared as the Surface Area of Rivers and Lakes (SARL) database, serving
      as a valuable resource for monitoring and research of hydrological cycles, ecosystem
      accounting, and water management.
