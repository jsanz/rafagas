    desc: 3,045 languages are endangered today. As with the total number of languages,
      this count changes constantly. A language becomes endangered when its users
      begin to teach and speak a more dominant language to the children in the community.
      Due to their nature, endangered languages often have few speakers left, and
      it may be difficult to get information about them. Other times, the last known
      speaker of a language may die without public records.
