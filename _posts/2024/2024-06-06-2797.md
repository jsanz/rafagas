    desc: In the previous post i discussed a bit the history of digital map design,
      in particular also outside of OpenStreetMap. I also wrote in the past about
      the history of OpenStreetMap Carto, the cartographic face of OpenStreetMap and
      without doubt the most influential map design project in OpenStreetMap – today
      as well as historically. But it is neither the only map design endeavor in and
      around OpenStreetMap, nor is it going to be in its current position forever.
      In this post i am going to discuss various other map design projects – historic
      and present – that exist in and around OpenStreetMap and that substantially
      have shaped or are shaping map design in OpenStreetMap.
