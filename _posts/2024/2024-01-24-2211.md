    desc: Spatial signatures represent spatial patterns of land cover in a given area.
      Thus, they can be used to search for areas with similar spatial patterns to
      a query region or to quantify changes in spatial patterns. The approaches above
      are implemented as lsp_search() and lsp_compare() functions of the motif R package,
      respectively.

    desc: Here you will find content, including books and beyond, on reproducible
      geographic data analysis, modeling, and visualization with open source software.
      The project and this website evolved from the website originally created to
      host content around Geocomputation with R. Since the publication of that book
      in 2019, the community around the book has grown and now includes a nascent
      ‘geocompy’ community and the associated Geocomputation with Python open source
      book project. It became clear that the ‘geocompr’ name was no longer appropriate
      for the more multi-lingual nature of the project.
