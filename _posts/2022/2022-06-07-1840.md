    desc: The recent wave of published global maps of ecological variables has caused
      as much excitement as it has received criticism. Here we look into the data
      and methods mostly used for creating these maps, and discuss whether the quality
      of predicted values can be assessed, globally and locally.

      2. Borrow trash pliers from the library.

      3. Spend a fun day at the beach and picking up trash.

      4. Leave the trash bags in the big bins that can be found on the map.

      5. Let us know that the beach has been cleaned!'
