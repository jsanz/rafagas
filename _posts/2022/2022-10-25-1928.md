    desc: Black carbon and dust deposition advanced the end of the snow season by
      17 days on average over the last 40 years in the French Alps and the Pyrenees.
      The warming-induced snow cover decline was partly offset by decreases in black
      carbon deposition observed since the 1980s.

      cosmogonía del inicio. Felicidades a la ciudad.”
